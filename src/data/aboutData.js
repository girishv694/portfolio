    description1: "My name is Girish V, I'm a Full-stack Web Developer.",
    description2: "I graduated from VTU Belagavi, B.E in Computer Science and Engineering. When I was 10, my father brought a new phone, and I was very curious about the themes and colors in it. Later, I came to know that a software was used in these phones for themes and colors. This is how I developed interest in software development. As a programmer, I love taking challenges and love being part of the solution, with an avid interest in data structures and algorithms. Hands-on experience in analysis, development and implementation. Solid programming expertise in Java, Java script, Mongo DB, React, Express and Node. A fast learner with creative problem solving skills and good communication skills. Would be interested in MERN stack development for proving and enriching my knowledge and skills.",
